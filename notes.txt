Quarc Templates fill board specific options in HIL-1 Block.

To fix/prevent, make sure board specific options is empty in your simulink
model before saving. Then make sure to SAVE the model! If it is unsaved it seems this causes
the board specific options to be auto filled. If you save the model before 
saving as template it seems it will not fill the board specific options 
text. Hopefully this is how to prevent this from happening on all templates!
